Moreover I have a strong command of React Native for cross-platform mobile app development. With a solid background in database management, particularly MySQL, I design robust and scalable systems. 

Eager to explore the possibilities of Next Js for server-rendered React applications, I stay updated with the latest technologies and continuously seek growth opportunities. 

Committed to delivering high-quality solutions my goal is to make a positive impact in the tech industry through innovative and efficient development practices.
